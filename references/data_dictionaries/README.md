## `references/data_dictionaries/`

A data dictionary documents the scope, purpose, and nuance of the data you are collecting. Some data dictionaries are extensively detailed, but even a basic minimal data dictionary is better than none at all. Data dictionaries are usually used for tabular datasets, but can be used for data in other formats as well.
