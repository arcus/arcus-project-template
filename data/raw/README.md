## `data/raw/`

This directory holds authoritative source data that should never be deleted. This directory can be further organized into sub-directories as needed.

Raw data files should be listed in [`manifests/file_manifest.csv`](../manifests/file_manifest.csv).

## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is required, as all project should have raw data.

A README for the `data/raw/` directory is required.
